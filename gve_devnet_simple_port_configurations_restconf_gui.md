GVE DevNet Simple Ports Configurations RESTCONF GUI
=====================================

In this PoV, we created a GUI that can make simple ports configurations to IOS-XE devices using RESTCONF. Examples of configurations include adding and deleting VLANs, 
enabling and disabling interfaces, adjusting speed and duplex settings. Moreover, the GUI provides an overview of common `show` commands, e.g., 
`show ip int brief`, `show vlan`, etc., but also general interface information.
