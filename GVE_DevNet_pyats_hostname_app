GVE DevNet PyATS Hostname App
=====================================

We created a Flask application that can find all the devices on a certain Meraki network. Through a CDP/LLDP request, we can obtain the information about the neighbors. We connect with the neighboring device in order to obtain the hostname from its configuration and we use this hostname to configure the Meraki device.
