GVE DevNet pyATS Config Diff Comparison
=====================================

This solution provides scripts to automate the testing by using pyATS. We create a baseline, by taking an initial snapshot, and then after our changes, we take another snapshot and we compare it to the initial snapshot. Afterwards, we generate a report, which highlights the differences and the results of the tests.
