GVE DevNet Meraki MV People Detection
=====================================

We have created a script that can subscribe to a Meraki MV telemetry stream through a MQTT broker and it can detect whether a person is loitering for more than a set threshold. In case the person is detected for longer than the set threshold, then a Webex notification is sent to a recipient through a Webex bot.
